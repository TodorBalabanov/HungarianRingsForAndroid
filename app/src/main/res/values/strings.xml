\nIt is a really popular game that has something similar with the Rubikâ€™s Cube.
\n
\nFirst you need to shuffle the puzzle and after that the goal is to return it in the starting state, using two directional rotations of the rings. To do that you should click on tokens in the rings.
\n
\nThere are two rings labeled as A (red-blue) and B (green-purple). Rings can be rotated in two directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise). By this way four operations over the game could be constructed:
\n
\n+A\tRotate ring A clockwise.
\n-A\tRotate ring A counter-clockwise.
\n+B\tRotate ring B clockwise.
\n-B\tRotate ring B counter-clockwise.
\n
\nThese operations can be used to construct expressions. For example:
\n
\n+A+B
\nRotate ring A clockwise after that rotate ring B clockwise.
\n
\n+A-A+B-B
\nNothing has been changed after the rotation.
\n
\nThese expressions can be extended by inserting one digit between the sign and the letter. For example:
\n
\n+9A+9B
\nRotate ring A clockwise nine times and after that rotate ring B clockwise nine times.
\n
\nBy proper formulas puzzle can be solved each time. Some tips:
\n+5A+5B-5A-5B
\n+5A-5B-5A+5B</string>

\nThis puzzle consists of two intersecting rings made up of a number of colored balls. The rings of balls intersect at two places, so they share two of the balls. Each ring of balls can be turned, so the balls can be mixed.
